Please put revised work distribution above.
Total above should be 100%
Explain reason for change here.

Unfortunately, we placed our UTORID's in the sprintbacklog instead of the productbacklog so none of the
marks were redistributed based on what each member did. We have added our UTORID's to all completed
Userstories and Bugs in the productbacklog and hope each of our marks are adjusted accordingly.

The revised distrubtion above is just an idea of what we feel each member did based on our productbacklog as 
we do not know the exact weight of each specific bug/UserStory.

Since our marks for architecture only came from code written by galegoer
and liwill13, we feel like they should receive more credit.
