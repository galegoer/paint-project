# User Stories/Bugs (add as appropriate), modify at each Sprint Planning Meeting
# If a USER STORY is large, break it into smaller user stories.
# For example, the color chooser user story involves:
# 1 Color chooser UI (which could be a USER STORY)
# 2 Implementation of selected color into the drawing stream.
