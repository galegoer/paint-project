	Today     : Met up and divided the work
	Obstacles :

Oct 31, 2018
	Yesterday :
	Today     : Completed UserStory1, began UserStory4
	Obstacles : Couldn't test UserStory4 as UserStory3 was not complete

Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday : Completed UserStory1, began UserStory4
	Today     : Began work on UserStory6, met up with group
	Obstacles : Thinking of new ways to organize models/modes

Nov 2, 2018
	Yesterday : Began UserStory6, met up with group helped with UserStory3
	Today     : Continued with UserStory6 thinking of new way to implement it, tried with an ArrayList of modes to keep
		    track of the shape mode and style mode. Tried to test UserStory4 as UserStory3 was completed but had trouble
		    with the old code merging with master
	Obstacles : Had trouble merging UserStory4 branch to keep up with master code. Had trouble adding the buttons to the left
		    section of the BorderPane without replacing them so had to leave them at the bottom for now

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday : Continued with UserStory6 thinking of new way to implement it, tried with an ArrayList of modes to keep
		    track of the shape mode and style mode. Tried to test UserStory4 as UserStory3 was completed but had trouble
		    with the old code merging with master
	Today     : UserStory4 Completed, UserStory6 Completed. Compiled everything together with the colors
	Obstacles : Many merge errors today as every update changed a lot of the code so had to manually fix the merges

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday : Completed UserStory 4 and 6
	Today     : Did not have much time to code because of other assignments, thought of some general ideas for
		    a new design pattern
	Obstacles : Several assignments due and a test to study for did not have enough time to think of a 
		    good design pattern

Nov 5, 2018
	Yesterday : Finished other assignments
	Today     : Studied for stats test
	Obstacles : Didn't have time to code

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday : Studied for stats
	Today     : Reviewed design patterns, thought of some ideas that we could use, possibly an iterator
		    for the objects (circle, square, etc.). Possibly Strategy Pattern for the PaintPanel.
	Obstacles : Hard to think of the code for this as it is similar to starting from scratch.

Nov 7, 2018
	Yesterday : Reviewed design patterns, thought of general ideas
	Today     : Began on squiggle bug, realized it'd be easier to do repainting bug first
		    thought of factory design pattern as our design pattern.
	Obstacles : Lots of design patterns to choose from.

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday : Began squiggle bug, thought of design patterns.
	Today     : Thought of new design pattern, command, noticed that Bug4 somewhat overlaps with
		    Bug7. Added the command design pattern still under construction.
	Obstacles : Difficult to implement the design pattern as it requires most of your code to be
		    in a sense, reset.

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday : Added command design pattern, working on command design pattern for Bug4/7
	Today     : Finished Bug4 and somewhat of Bug7 because of the overlap. Found bug with clear
		    canvas as we do not refer to it in ArrayLists anymore. Completed that Bug(12).
		    Began squiggle almost finished.
	Obstacles : Many merge conflicts because entire architecture changed had to get used to all
		    the new code. Some errors with Squiggle behaviour won't register a point null?

Nov 10, 2018
	Yesterday : Finished Bug4, some of Bug7. Completed Bug12.
	Today     : Almost finished squiggle, makes dotted lines like squiggle, aren't connected.
	Obstacles : Kept making dotted lines instead of a squiggle.
	
Nov 11, 2018
	Yesterday : Almost finished squiggle.
	Today     : Finished squiggle. Completed other assignments.
	Obstacles : Had a lot of other homework.
	
Nov 12, 2018
	Yesterday : Finished squiggle. Completed other assignments.
	Today     : Added undo and redo functions. Bug7 is complete. Began work on Bug13
		    polyline undo and redo.
	Obstacles : Polyline is a unique implementation so it has some
		    errors when undoing/redoing.

Nov 13, 2018
	Yesterday : Added undo and redo functions. Began work on Bug13
	Today     : Studied for CSC236, looked at possible implementation for Bug10
	Obstacles : CSC236

Nov 14, 2018
	Yesterday : Studied 236, looked at possible implementation for Bug10.
	Today     : Failed 236. Split up Bug10 began work on it.
	Obstacles : CSC236, not enough time.

Nov 15, 2018
	Yesterday : Failed 236, split up bug10 began work on it.
	Today     : Tried to help with Bug8. Added Javadoc for my clases and functions.
	Obstacles : Couldn't complete the bugs.
