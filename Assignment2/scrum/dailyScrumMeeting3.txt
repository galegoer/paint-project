	Today     :Started working on the UserStory3.
	Obstacles :The obstacle I faced was to understand how to get height and width using two points.

Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday :Still working on the userStory3. 
	Today     :Changed the approach of going at the user story. INstead of thinking it as a diagnol I started consider the begin and end point of diagnol.
	Obstacles :Couldn't get the rectangle to draw properly. Later I realised that I was visualising the canvas wrong because of which the rectangles were not perfect.

	Yesterday :
	Today     :Finished working on the Userstory3. Started working on the userStory7. 
	Obstacles : Took some time to understand how to go about solving the UserStory7.

Nov 3, 2018
	Yesterday : working on UserStory7
	Today     : Still working on the UserStory7.
	Obstacles :Understanding how to implement a slider. 

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday : Trying to implement a slider
	Today     : Successfully implemented a slider. Now started working on line thickness.
	Obstacles : Don't know how to communicate with a sliders. 

Nov 5, 2018
	Yesterday :Implemented a slider.
	Today     : Still trying to find a way to communicate to a slider. Got some hint regarding to use actionlisteners for it.
	Obstacles : Major obstacle has been to figure out how to use action listeners. 

Nov 6, 2018
	Yesterday :Researching how to implement slider successfully.
	Today     : Made some progress but line thickness still doesn't work properly.
	Obstacles : Didn't really get much time to work on it because of Stats test. Now major onstacle is to figure out how to adjust line thickness of a circle or other shapes.

Nov 7, 2018
	Yesterday : Researching how to adjust the line thickness of shapes.
	Today     : Still working on the code.
	Obstacles : Haven't been able to connect line thickness to slider. Its turning into a big problem. Thinking of contacting a TA or a professor for some help.

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday : Working on line thickness. UserStory7.
	Today     : Finished working on UserStory7. This thing took way ore time than it should have. Started working on Bug 8.
	Obstacles : Placement of the line thickness was the only tricky part. But it's done now.

Nov 9, 2018
	Yesterday :Finished user story 7 and started working on bug 8.
	Today     : Still working on bug 8. Got sick so didn't make much progress.
	Obstacles : got really sick.

Nov 10, 2018
	Yesterday :Started working on bug 8.
	Today     :Did research on what command design pattern is because it is important for bug 8. Took a really long time to get a grasp of command design pattern.
	Obstacles :The major obstacle was mostly not finding the time to do bug 8 properly. Been busy from morning with other courses as well.
	
Nov 11, 2018
	Yesterday : Working on Bug 8.
	Today     : Stopped working on bug 8 and started working on the UserStory13. UserStory13 is about the feature to be able to draw rounded rectangles. 
	Obstacles : The major obstacle was finding the relationship between rectangle height and arcHeight, rectangle width and arcWidth. Researching this took most of my time. ALso in the end while commiting and merging my work, for some reason the merge didn't work properly and I had to do UserStory over again.
	
Nov 12, 2018
	Yesterday :Finished working on UserStory13.  Bug8 is still in progress.
	Today     : Started working on UserStory15. UserStory15 is about the feature to be able to draw rounded squares. Bug8 is also in working.
	Obstacles :No major obstacles for UserStory15.

Nov 13, 2018
	Yesterday :Started working on the Userstory15.
	Today     :Finished working on UserStory15. Also resumed working on Bug8.
	Obstacles :Had to study for csc236 test that is on 14(tomorrow) for most of the day.

Nov 14, 2018
	Yesterday :Worked on Bug8.
	Today     :Worked on Bug8 a bit. Hopefully I'll finish it by the end of tom.
	Obstacles :Had a csc test today at 8pm. So spent most of the time preparing for it and didn't get much time for Bug8.
