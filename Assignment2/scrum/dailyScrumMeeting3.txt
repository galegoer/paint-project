	Today     :Started working on the UserStory3.
	Obstacles :The obstacle I faced was to understand how to get height and width using two points.

Nov 1, 2018
	Yesterday :Still working on the userStory3. 
	Today     :Changed the approach of going at the user story. INstead of thinking it as a diagnol I started consider the begin and end point of diagnol.
	Obstacles :Couldn't get the rectangle to draw properly. Later I realised that I was visualising the canvas wrong because of which the rectangles were not perfect.

	Today     :Finished working on the Userstory3. Started working on the userStory7. 
	Obstacles : Took some time to understand how to go about solving the UserStory7.

	Yesterday : working on UserStory7
	Today     : Still working on the UserStory7.
	Obstacles :Understanding how to implement a slider. 

Nov 4, 2018
	Yesterday : Trying to implement a slider
	Today     : Successfully implemented a slider. Now started working on line thickness.
	Obstacles : Don't know how to communicate with a sliders. 

Nov 5, 2018
	Yesterday :Implemented a slider.
	Today     : Still trying to find a way to communicate to a slider. Got some hint regarding to use actionlisteners for it.
	Obstacles : Major obstacle has been to figure out how to use action listeners.

	Yesterday :Researching how to implement slider successfully.
	Today     : Made some progress but line thickness still doesn't work properly.
	Obstacles : Didn't really get much time to work on it because of Stats test. Now major onstacle is to figure out how to adjust line thickness of a circle or other shapes.

Nov 7, 2018
	Yesterday : Researching how to adjust the line thickness of shapes.
	Today     : Still working on the code.
	Obstacles : Haven't been able to connect line thickness to slider. Its turning into a big problem. Thinking of contacting a TA or a professor for some help.

Nov 8, 2018
	Yesterday : Working on line thickness. UserStory7.
	Today     : Finished working on UserStory7. This thing took way ore time than it should have.
	Obstacles : Placement of the line thickness was the only tricy part. But it's done now.
